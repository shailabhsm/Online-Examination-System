		1.Role of online exams in educatiionFast Process: Traditional exams are good, but it takes them many days or months to display the result of the examination as	the copies are checked manually. While in online examination, checking and result process is completely online performed by a computer that makes it faster. Results of an online exam can be declared within a few days of the exam.
		<br>
		<br>
		2.Remote Access: Another benefit of online examination is that it can be conducted from anywhere with easy access to any part of the world. Since the internet is in the reach of everyone, an online exam can be accessed easily anywhere.
		<br>
		<br>
		3.High Accuracy: As the results of online exams are checked by a machine, the accuracy level is high. A man can easily make mistakes while checking exam copy, but with a computer, the probability is very low. In a traditional exam pattern, we may need to get our copies rechecked in the case of any dispute, but we  will never need this with an online examination process as the probability of mistakes is very low.
		<br>
		<br>
		4.Resources: Though an online exam needs more resources than a traditional exam, but these resources are reusable. In an online examination, you will need to use a computer and the internet, which you need not to purchase as you can always find one on rent. In traditional exams, we use papers and pen/pencils, which are wasted after the exam. You cannot use an exam paper again for another purpose. This way, we can make better use of the resources through online exams.
